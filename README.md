# Content-Moderation
  In today’s world where social media platform plays a crucial role in everyone’s public and private life, hate comments make up approximately 10% of the tweets and comments, and is steadily increasing over time. This often leads to anxiety, depression, and in worst case scenario could result in violent uprising and social unrest like the capitol riots in
Washington on January 6th, 2021. Even after a few content moderation systems in place, we still witness the abuse of anonymity and freedom of speech in social media. Hence, a sophisticated content moderation system is the need of the hour that limits the spread of hate.

    Flag out hate comments from the craigs list discussion forums to responsible community protecting website from hate, increase its online presence, and enhance the brand value.
  So I have developed a solution to fix this. When the religion discussion forum is analyzed, hate comments majorly reflected racism (person’s complexion), discrimination (autism), and abuse of power (police brutality
in George Floyd’s case) along with other minor concerns. Using the Artificial Neural Network model, we can classify whether a comment relates to hatred and flag out the comments related to hatred with AUC value of 0.76 (94% accuracy)
